**Hi!**

Thanks for taking the tine to check out my resume! 

As you've seen, I have a broad experience and skill set, with more than just tech skills to offer. I'm an entrepreneur, leader, team builder and coach. I like to lead by learning along with or from my teammates as we venture into territory that is not well known. I'm also a musician, a percussionist and improvisationist. Improvisational music is the art of knowing what will happen next, expected or unexpected, and being there to make it happen. As a percussionist, my job is to provide a solid foundation and space for the band to explore the unknown, to highlight their abilities while they do. Leading engineers I do the same.
